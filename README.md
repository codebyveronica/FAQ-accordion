## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- JavaScript

### What I learned

I learned A LOT from this project. I wanted to get out of the tutorials and try to create something myself with what I already learned. It was difficult, it took a considerable amount of time and a lot of research between forums and libraries, but I did it. I'm so proud of my JS code. I really had no idea how to put all the elements together, but in the end, I managed to build the functionality I wanted. And this made me learn a lot about EventListener, target, and it was great practice with variables, functions and loops. Loops mainly because I didn't know before that it was possible to add EventListener through a ForEach.

### Continued development

I will build more projects with JavaScript, without leaving aside HTML and CSS. I want to be building big projects soon.

### Useful resources

- [W3Schools](https://www.w3schools.com) - It helped me a lot when researching with JS.
